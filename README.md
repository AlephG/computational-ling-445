# Coursework for Computational Linguistics
This repository contains assignment submissions for Computational Linguistics taught by Prof. Timothy O'Donnell at McGill University in the Fall 2021 semester.
Files for each assignment are in their respective folders ps[x].

## ps1
In this problem set, we explored fundamental ideas from functional programming using the LISP dialect Clojure.
## ps2
In this problem set, we learn more about recursive procedures which are crucial in a functional programming setting. Furthermore, we prove certain properties of formal languages using set theory notions (see pdf from that problem set)
